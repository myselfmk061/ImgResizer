## Core Features:

- Photo Upload: Allow users to upload photos from their device.
- Dimension Input: Specify exact dimensions (width and height) in pixels for resizing.
- Percentage Scaling: Scale images by percentage, keeping original aspect ratio.
- Aspect Ratio Lock: Maintain aspect ratio by default to prevent image distortion. Give the user a tool to unlock and distort images.

- Image Preview: Show a preview of the resized image before downloading.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, professional blue (#6699CC), reflecting trust and clarity. It is far from the cliches often associated with 'blue,' like sadness. Rather, this hue evokes the authority and cleanliness of the user prompt's intended mood.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (#E6F0FA), creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting vibrant orange (#FFA500), to draw attention to calls to action, clearly setting the actions apart from the general UI without dominating the look.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text.
- Use clean, simple icons representing dimensions, scaling, and quality settings.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for uploading, specifying dimensions, and downloading.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback during image processing and download.
